# Concentration
* First assignment of Stanford's iOS Development course -- making Concentration
* My code does not borrow from the starter code since I have no access to it
* Instead this project is built from scratch with the help from the instructor's knowledge of the language and project specifications

# Goals
* To get hands dirty with `Swift`, `XCode`, `iOS development`, `UIKit` and see how well MVC works for a mobile app
* To familliarize oneself with programming once again -- debugging, design patterns, maintaining the right environment, version control

# Standout Features
* Reset flip counter
* Detect matching cards
* Randomly selected emojis from a set for a chosen theme
* MVC

# Future Features
* High Scores
* Launch Screen
* Start and End Game
* Difficulty (i.e. number of cards, timed window to see flipped card before it flips back)
* Complete Implementation of selecting a theme
* Add more themes
* Transfer static theme code from `ThemeGenerator` to a `json` file

# Screenshots

* Demos showcasing the completed implementation of one round of the game
